## Project Background & Overview
***Turning Cultural Prestige into Global Profitability***

While Ghibli and Shinkai elevated Anime to a global art form, the industry now faces a structural paradox. With Japan's domestic market at saturation, the $25B industry, now growing overseas, is entering its most ambitious era of expansion.

***The Mission: Decoding Success***
This project aims to decode the "recipe" for global IP success seen in powerhouses like Attack on Titan, Naruto, and Ghibli titles. 

We are analysing these frameworks to:

- **title** : text 

- **De-Risk Global Investment**: My high-recall model replaces "creative gambling" with Data-Backed Asset Valuation, ensuring that high-potential IPs receive the global resources (EN/ES/PT localisation) they deserve.


## 📊 Data Architecture 
This project integrates multi-dimensional datasets to bridge the gap between "artistic popularity" and "commercial global success."

## 🤖 The Machine Learning Objective
The core of this repository is a predictive framework designed to classify the commercial trajectory of new Japanese IP.

Goal: Success Probability Forecasting
Using statistical testing and supervised learning, we categorize titles into two primary buckets:

- 🌟 Global Hit: High probability of cross-border success, tourism generation, and long-tail licensing.

- 🏮 Niche/Local: High domestic value but limited "cultural portability" or international scalability.

Technical Note: I utilised feature engineering on the "Triple-Dip" model (Manga -> Anime -> Merch/Game) to determine if a title has the structural support to survive outside the traditional production committee system.

##  📈 Executive Summary
- **The Challenge** : Detecting "Global Hits" is a needle-in-a-haystack problem (only 2.7% of titles). Standard models fail because they over-predict "flops" to stay safe.
- **The Solution**: I evolved my approach from simple classification to a Prestige-Recall Engine. By engineering a "Prestige Score" and tuning for sensitivity, I achieved 94% Recall.
- **The Impact**: This model eliminates "creative gambling," identifying the 1% of assets that drive 90% of global revenue with near-perfect reliability.

## 💡Insight Deepdive 
- **Execution Alpha**: Studio pedigree is the #1 force-multiplier. High-potential IP must be paired with studios that have IP Ownership (e.g., MAPPA, KyoAni) to ensure quality alignment.
- **The Emotional Moat**: While Action "hooks" fans, Drama and Fantasy drive the long-term loyalty and merchandise sales that sustain an IP for decades.
  
## 🎯 Recommendations
- **Linguistic Velocity**: Focus "Day-and-Date" localsation on the GDP Power Trio (EN, ES, FR) to capture 52% of global demand immediately.
- **Prioritize "Execution Alpha"**: Align high-potential IPs with studios that hold equity stakes (e.g., MAPPA, KyoAni). Ownership ensures the production quality required to hit the "Prestige" threshold.
- **Monetize Emotional Intensity**: Use the model to identify IPs that drive deep fan loyalty. Reinvest in these "high-intensity" titles to build resilient, high-LTV (Lifetime Value) fanbases that sustain an IP through merchandise and sequels for decades.
