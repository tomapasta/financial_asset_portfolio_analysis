## Project Background & Overview
***Turning Cultural Prestige into Global Profitability***

While Ghibli and Shinkai elevated Anime to a global art form, the industry now faces a structural paradox. With Japan's domestic market at saturation, the $25B industry, now growing overseas, is entering its most ambitious era of expansion.


## 📊 Data Architecture 
This project integrates multi-dimensional datasets to bridge the gap between "artistic popularity" and "commercial global success."

##  📈 Executive Summary
- **** : 
- **The Solution**: I evolved my approach from simple classification to a Prestige-Recall Engine. By engineering a "Prestige Score" and tuning for sensitivity, I achieved 94% Recall.
- **The Impact**: This model eliminates "creative gambling," identifying the 1% of assets that drive 90% of global revenue with near-perfect reliability.

## 💡Insight Deepdive 
- **Execution Alpha**: Studio pedigree is the #1 force-multiplier. High-potential IP must be paired with studios that have IP Ownership (e.g., MAPPA, KyoAni) to ensure quality alignment.
- **The Emotional Moat**: While Action "hooks" fans, Drama and Fantasy drive the long-term loyalty and merchandise sales that sustain an IP for decades.
  
## 🎯 Recommendations
- **Adding High quality value stocks**: Increase exposure to "Old Economy" industries, specifically Healthcare, Industrial, and Financials. These sectors typically consist of established companies with consistent cash flows and lower price fluctuations. 
- **High Liquidity : Intermediate term treasuries (3-10 yrs)**: These funds focus on government securities with a 3~10-year maturity, offering a "sweet spot" of higher yields than short-term cash and lower price sensitivity than long-term bonds.
