## Project Background & Overview
***Turning Cultural Prestige into Global Profitability***

While Ghibli and Shinkai elevated Anime to a global art form, the industry now faces a structural paradox. With Japan's domestic market at saturation, the $25B industry, now growing overseas, is entering its most ambitious era of expansion.


## 📊 Data Architecture 
This project integrates multi-dimensional datasets to bridge the gap between "artistic popularity" and "commercial global success."

##  📈 Executive Summary
- **Proven Resilience** : Through Volatility Despite the unprecedented "COVID dip," the portfolio's diversified structure enabled a rapid recovery, driven by the exceptional performance of Tech stocks and REITs (specifically data centers).
- **Validated Risk-Reward Architecture**: Correlation and volatility data confirm that the assets are effectively decoupled; the government bond "anchors" protected the portfolio during downturns, while the "growth engines" captured significant market upside.
- **Dynamic Weight Management**: To mitigate future "Black Swan" events, we will continue to dynamically rebalance asset weights—reducing exposure to shrinking sectors and capitalizing on emerging growth to ensure long-term wealth accumulation.
  
## 🎯 Recommendations
- **Adding High quality value stocks**: Increase exposure to "Old Economy" industries, specifically Healthcare, Industrial, and Financials. These sectors typically consist of established companies with consistent cash flows and lower price fluctuations. 
- **High Liquidity : Intermediate term treasuries (3-10 yrs)**: These funds focus on government securities with a 3~10-year maturity, offering a "sweet spot" of higher yields than short-term cash and lower price sensitivity than long-term bonds.
